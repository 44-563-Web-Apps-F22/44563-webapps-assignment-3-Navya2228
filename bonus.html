<h1 style="color:navy blue">Greenville Giraffe</h1>
<p>They are the tallest mammals in the world. They have a special adaptation that allows them to access vegetation that other herbivores cannot. When giraffes' heads are abruptly elevated, lowered, or swung, unusually elastic blood arteries and specially designed valves assist counteract the sudden buildup of blood (to prevent fainting). Their "horns" are actually knobs above the eyes that serve as a head protector and are covered in skin and hair. They have seven vertebrae in their necks, the same number as humans, but because of their enlarged bones, their necks are far longer than oursâ€”2.4 meters.</p>
